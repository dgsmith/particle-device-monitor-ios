# particle-device-monitor-ios
An iOS app to view and interact with your Particle devices' variables and functions!

I wanted an easy way to view my Particle variables and functions for debugging and general usage so I wrote this up. Currently you are able to:

- View all devices owned by you
- View each devices' status
- View each devices' cloud variables and functions (if online)
- Refresh variable values by selecting the value in the table
- Call a function by selecting one in the table

Still in progress but planned improvements are:

- Apple Watch app and Glance (maybe star a variable and be able to quickly see it -- or maybe a complication?)
- Notification Center widget
- Better GUI?
